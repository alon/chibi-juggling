Chibi Juggling, for lack of a better name, is meant to create juggling balls around the chibi boards, to teach juggling. The chibi boards have an 8-bit atmel mcu with zigbee rf, and an adxl addon. Together, and adding some unspecified output device (lights / sounds / vibration) they can give cues to would be jugglers that the throw is not timed correctly, or not strong enough or too strong etc.
